PAGE: The TRIP of a Lifetime!

(“ABOUT”, but be vague, just staff and bus details)

As the bus leaves the town behind and heads for the country, everything begins to change. Well, almost everything.

And already, the magic is beginning to work...

PAGE: The Right View

(“STOPS/ATTRACTIONS”, but be vague)

If you look to your left, ladies and gentlemen, the view is not very inspiring. Ah, but if you look to your right...

- Flying: Beyond the blue horizon, far above the clouds, in a land that no one knows. A secret place, where the eyes of man have never set foot.

- Fool’s Hill: See the sun going down and the world spinning round from Fool’s Hill.

- Ancient Roman Ruins: They really have been there an awful long time. They are, in fact, a little difficult to see because they’re almost flattened to the ground...

- English Garden: Sit in an English garden waiting for the sun. If the sun doesn’t come, you’ll get a tan from standing in the English rain.

- And animals of many kinds: Walrus, rabbits, chickens, hippos – and eggmen. Goo goo g'joob!

Bluejay Way: Please don’t be long. Please don’t you be very long.
